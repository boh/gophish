Gophish fork
=======

This is a fork of Gophish: Open-Source Phishing Toolkit [Gophish](https://getgophish.com)

### New features

This fork has a focus on running real-life phishing campaigns for a single customer. The following features are added:

- Script to automatically setup a fully configured Gophish instance on a fresh VPS. This allows you to have a single VPS for each of your customers. This helps preventing data leaks and you can completely destroy the VPS after you completed your campaigns.
- Support for running your landingpage on both HTTP & HTTPS (HTTP will 301 to HTTPS).
- Support for displaying a default landingpage if no RID is provided (instead of showing a 404).
- Automatically install Let's encrypt Certificates for your domains.
- Support for tracking the opening of malicious Word attachments and enabling Macro's inside these documents. 
- More to be developed...
